# BinaryChain Blockchain Development Documentation

This document outlines the comprehensive steps and meticulous processes undertaken to develop the BinaryChain blockchain, highlighting its innovative features and robust development phases aimed at delivering a high-performance and secure blockchain solution.

## Project Overview

BinaryChain is an advanced Ethereum-based fork blockchain protocol, designed to address and enhance several key areas of blockchain technology. Our protocol ensures secure contract deployment, delivering high performance and seamless integration with existing Ethereum-based applications, whitch can pass our security ptotocol, all while incorporating a rigorous verification process to maintain the integrity and security of the network.

BinaryChain places a premium on security. Every smart contract deployed on our network must pass a comprehensive verification process, ensuring that only secure, reliable contracts are executed. This reduces the risk of vulnerabilities and exploits that are common in other blockchain networks.

## Development Phases

### Base Core Development

**Development processes:**

- Conduct a full analysis of the existing codebase to determine the best approach for adding new features.
- Extend core blockchain functionalities to support new capabilities.
- Develop deep smart contract integration to enhance interoperability and security.
- Create a prototype to validate the design and architecture, ensuring alignment with project goals.
- Elaborate potential issues identified during the early stages of development.
- Create a functional core aligned with our targets.
- Test the prototype in a controlled environment with different nodes to ensure stability and performance.

**Key Added Features:**

- **Transaction Checking System:** Only contracts approved by our community of Seekers and Hunters can be deployed to the chain, ensuring a higher level of security and trust.
- **Proof of Stake Mechanism:** Introduce a novel staking mechanism integrated deeply with the contract communication system to enhance both speed and security.
- **Validator Integration:** Only validators listed in our native contracts are authorized to validate blocks, ensuring a controlled and secure validation process.
- **Base Fee Division:** Implement core base fee division integrated with Tressury to manage transaction fees effectively.
- **SFC License Enforcement:** Ensure that only contracts with a valid SFC license can operate on the blockchain by making essential modifications to EVM calls, while maintaining full compatibility with the base EVM opcodes.

## Goals

- Develop a revolutionary delegate proof of stake mechanism as detailed in the whdwitepaper, setting a new standard in blockchain consensus algorithms.
- Add support for ISO20022 to enhance interoperability and compliance, facilitating smoother integration with financial institutions and regulatory frameworks.

## Conclusion

The development of BinaryChain represents a significant advancement in blockchain technology and security. Through meticulous planning, innovative design, and rigorous testing, we aim to create a blockchain solution that meets the demands of modern decentralized applications and enterprise use cases, with a strong focus on contract security. We look forward to the continued growth and adoption of BinaryChain within the blockchain community and its ongoing improvement and success.
